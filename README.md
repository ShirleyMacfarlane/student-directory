## How to use

Step 8  (Exercise 1 through 11) and Step 9 through Step 13 have been committed as separate files. There is a comment in each file indicating the purpose of the exercise.

Step 14: Exercises 1 through 7 take a version of the basic interactive menu code and each step improves the structure of the code using the  principles of refactoring. I have created a separate directory14_7.rb which incorporates all the code changes produced in each of these exercises.

Step 14: Exercise 8 (directory14_8.rb) contains a short program to read it's own code and print it on the screen.
